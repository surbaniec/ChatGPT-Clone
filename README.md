## General info

The project was implemented on the basis of the Sonny Sangha code live stream.
My main goal was to learn how to create applications in NextJS 13 with a new App directory.
My other goals were to learn how to write clean code, how to set up NextJS authentication and how to store data in Firestore database.
I also paid a lot of attention to the proper committing of changes.
